I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Mr. Rocky Shrestha for his graduate studies at your University. He completed his B.E. in Computer Engineering from Khwopa Engineering College, Purbanchal University, during the academic session 2020–2024.

I have been the Head of the Department of Computer Engineering at Khwopa Engineering College for the past five years. Along with leading the department, I also teach courses including Numerical Methods and Theory of Computation.

Mr. Shrestha took both of these courses with me in 2024 and demonstrated himself to be a sincere and hardworking student. He consistently showed curiosity and genuine interest in understanding the subject matter beyond what was taught in class. Among his peers, he was one of the more interactive students, frequently asking thoughtful, technical questions that reflected his strong analytical mindset.

I have also had the opportunity to interact with him outside the classroom in my capacity as department head, particularly during his involvement in the Hult Prize at Purbanchal University, Bhaktapur, in the year 2020–2021. He actively contributed to organizing programs and events alongside a team of 10 volunteers. His responsibilities included scheduling, coordinating arrangements, and assisting with training. Through this, he displayed commendable leadership qualities, professionalism, and a calm, respectful attitude while working with others.

Overall, Mr. Shrestha is a motivated and diligent student with a positive attitude toward learning and self-improvement. I believe he possesses the determination and capability required to excel in his future academic and professional endeavors. I am confident that he will be a valuable addition to your university.
